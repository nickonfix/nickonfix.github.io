I am a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/atheropoint" target="_blank">AtheroPoint</a>, where I work on developing **novel transformer-based architectures for biomedical and imaging applications**. My work focuses on advancing deep learning approaches for data-efficient model design, representation learning, and transformer optimization.  

I conduct my research under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AKJK7UQAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Jasjit Singh Suri</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=cppq2DcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Prof. Luca Saba</a>, whose mentorship has been instrumental in shaping my interest in transformer architectures and their extensions to domain-specific modeling.  

My broader research interests span **transformers**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, **multimodal learning**, and **representation learning**. I am particularly fascinated by how large-scale attention mechanisms can be adapted to improve interpretability, generalization, and robustness in real-world datasets.  

I am currently preparing for **MS/PhD applications**, aiming to contribute to research at the intersection of deep learning innovation and practical deployment, and to collaborate with researchers working on **transformers, NLP, and scalable model architectures**.

Previously, I completed my **Bachelor of Technology** from <a href="https://bvcoend.ac.in/" target="_blank">Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Engineering</a>, Delhi, where I was mentored by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4IC-Sw8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Dr. Arun K. Dubey</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=mFlMAqcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank">Dr. Rubbena Vohra</a>. My undergraduate research laid the foundation for my ongoing interests in **transformers**, **NLP**, and **representation learning**.  


<!-- As an undergrad, I was a research intern at IIT-Gandhinagar in 2017 and a summer student at Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai in 2018. I completed my BTech project at CMI where I was advised by Dr. [Partha Mukhopadhyay](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~partham/), and my master’s thesis with Dr. [Navin Kashyap](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~nkashyap/) at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. -->
