      abstract={We consider a fair resource allocation game in the no-regret setting against an unrestricted adversary. The objective of the problem is to allocate resources equitably among several agents in an online fashion so that the difference of the aggregate $\alpha$-fair utilities of the agents between an optimal static clairvoyant allocation and that of the online policy grows sub-linearly with time. The problem is challenging due to the non-additive nature of the $\alpha$-fairness function. Previously, it was shown that no online policy can  exist for this problem with a sublinear standard regret. In this paper, we propose an efficient online resource allocation policy, called Online Proportional Fair (\texttt{OPF}), that achieves $c_\alpha$-approximate sublinear regret with the approximation factor $c_\alpha=(1-\alpha)^{-(1-\alpha)}\leq 1.445,$ for $0\leq \alpha \leq 1$. The upper bound to the $c_\alpha$-regret for this problem exhibits a surprising \emph{phase transition} phenomenon. The regret bound changes from the power-law to a constant at the critical exponent $\alpha=\nicefrac{1}{2}.$  As a corollary, our result also resolves an open problem raised by \citet{even2009online} on designing an efficient no-regret policy for the online job scheduling problem in certain parameter regimes. The proof of our results introduces new algorithmic and analytical techniques, including greedy estimation of the future gradients for non-additive global reward functions and bootstrapping adaptive regret bounds, which may be of independent interest.}

      abstract={Background and Motivation: Accurate plaque segmentation and measurement in carotid
ultrasound scans is essential for effective diagnosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk
stratification. The latest techniques based on solo single stage deep learning UNet (M1:SS-
UNet) leads to inconsistency in low contrast scans. We hypothesize that variants of UNet
such as transformers can be more powerful paradigms.
Method: Design and develop novel single-stage UNet-based transformer (M6:SSwAttSkip-
XmerBot-UNet) for the far wall segmentation and intima-media thickness/plaque area
measurements in Japanese diabetic cohort. We use augmented data and cross-validation
protocol for performance evaluation and generalization. Performance evaluation includes 16
novel metrics, namely model complexity, model size, training efficiency, performance to
model size ratio, performance to complexity, and training time. We benchmarked our novel
transformer system against five models utilizing single and double stage attention-based
configurations namely M1:SS-UNet, single-stage with attention-UNet (M2:SSwAttSkip-
UNet), double-stage with attention-UNet (M3:DSwAttSkip-UNet), double-stage with
attention in decoder UNet (M4:DSwAttDeco-UNet) and single stage with transformer in the
bottle neck layer (M5:SSTransBot-UNet)
Results: The results showed that M6:SSwAttSkip-XmerBot-UNet achieved a perfect score of
100%, while M4:DSwAttDeco-UNet followed closely by 93.93%. Both models consistently
outperformed M1:SS-UNet, M2:SSwAttSkip-UNet, M3:DSwAttSkip-UNet and M5:
SSTransBot-UNet across all the 16 metrics. The final ranking of the UNet models were:
SSwAttSkip-XmerBot-UNet>DSwAttDeco-UNet>SS-UNet>SSTransBot-UNet>
SSwAttSkip-UNet>DSwAttSkip-UNet. M6:SSwAttSkip-XmerBot-UNet demonstrates
comparable effectiveness with greater efficiency, making it a strong alternative.
Conclusions: We conclude that transformer-based models like M6:SSwAttSkip-XmerBot-
UNet provide highly accurate, reliable, and automated technique that segments and measures
the risk of CVD.}

      abstract={Background and Motivation: UNet-based Deep Learning systems have dominated in the field
of medical imaging for segmentation of organs; however, it is not accurate, validated, or
generalized. Transformers or attention, on the other hand, provide solutions that are
sophisticated but use heavy-duty computations and take a long time to converge. This study
introduces a two-stage segmentation solution that combines transformers as tuners to the base
UNet, resulting in a highly accurate and generalizable solution.
Method: Three sets of base UNets were designed, namely, B1:UNet, B2: UNet++, and
B3:UNet+++, and four sets of tuners were designed, namely: T1:Transformer-augmented
UNet, T2:Attention-guided UNet, T3:Swin Transformer-based UNet, and T4:Pyramid-based
network, leading to 12 fusion systems that combine three base UNets and four Tuners, namely:
B1+T1, B1+T2, B1+T3, B1+T4; B2+T1, B2+T2, B2+T3, B2+T4; B3+T1, B3+T2, B3+T3,
B3+T4. A comparison is made on 13 important metrics, including model size, complexity,
training time, inference speed, and accuracy-to-parameter efficiency. Results show that
B1+T4, which achieved the highest normalisation score of 100%, was the best-performing system.
Results: Findings indicate that the two-stage segmentation model is more effective and reliable
than the single-stage UNet architecture. The combination of single UNet backbones and
transformers/attention mechanisms then creates a structure-sensitive and extremely nuanced
pipeline. Altogether, the proposed hybrid framework is scalable, high-throughput, and fits
properly into the real-life clinical practice where the accuracy and stability of segmentation
vital importance.
Conclusions: We conclude that Hybrid transformer-based models like B1+T4 provide highly
accurate, reliable, and automated techniques that segments and measure the risk of CVD.}

      abstract={Background and Motivation: Accurate plaque measurement in carotid ultrasound images is
essential for effective diagnosis and CVD risk stratification. Traditional methods for plaque
assessment rely on manual segmentation and rule-based approaches, leading to inconsistent
results and observer variability. Although deep learning (DL) models have increased
segmentation accuracy, they face challenges in dealing with complex plaque structures as
well as low contrast ultrasound images. This study aims to compare state-of-the-art AI-driven
models for carotid plaque measurement, evaluating their efficiency, robustness, and clinical
applicability in a Japanese cohort.
Method: This study evaluates three deep learning models, i.e., (i) conventional neural
networks(cNonAtt-dsCNN), (ii) attention-enhanced U-Net(cAtt-ssUNet),(iii) a two-stage
attention-based method(cAtt-dsUNet) and compares against commercial AtheroEdge™
2.0(AE2.0) from AtheroPoint, CA, USA-an automated method. All three DL models were
trained on the same Japanese data with identical hyperparameters using the Adam optimizer,
batch size 32, and a learning rate of 0.001 on an NVIDIA GPU cluster. The metrics used
were: (i) total plaque area, and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), giving the automated
lumen-intima, and media-adventitia (LIMA) boundaries in the far wall carotid ultrasound
scans. The performance of these models was assessed using (i) Dice similarity, (ii) Jaccard
index on binary segmented walls, and (iii) polyline distance metric for measuring cIMT.
Conclusions: cAtt-dsUNet outperformed traditional DL methods and is comparable to the
commercial system AtheroEdge™.}

  abstract={In the learning literature, the performance of an online policy is commonly measured in terms of the static regret metric, which compares the cumulative loss of an online policy to that of an optimal benchmark in hindsight. In the definition of static regret, the benchmark policy remains fixed throughout the time horizon. Naturally, the resulting regret bounds become loose in non-stationary settings where fixed benchmarks often suffer from poor performance. In this paper, we investigate a stronger notion of regret minimization in the context of an online caching problem. In particular, we allow the action of the offline benchmark at any round to be decided by a finite state predictor containing arbitrarily many states. Using ideas from the universal prediction literature in information theory, we propose an efficient online caching policy with an adaptive sub-linear regret bound. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first data-dependent regret bound known for the universal caching problem. We establish this result by combining a recently-proposed online caching policy with an incremental parsing algorithm, e.g., Lempel-Ziv '78. Our methods also yield a simpler learning-theoretic proof of the improved regret bound as opposed to the more involved and problem-specific combinatorial arguments used in the earlier works.}

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
